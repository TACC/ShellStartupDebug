Shell Startup Debug:

To trace the behavior of the startup scripts on your system use
shell_startup_debug.

Once installed, any user can create a file (~/.init.sh for bash, zsh, etc) and
(~/.init.csh for csh and tcsh) that will turn on the report of the startup
behavior.

Bash users: Please put in ~/.init.sh:

   export SHELL_STARTUP_DEBUG=1

Csh users: Pleasu put in ~/.init.csh:

   setenv SHELL_STARTUP_DEBUG 1

A bash user will see something like the following for output:

   /etc/profile{
      /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh{
      } Time = 0.0550
      /etc/profile.d/lmod.sh{
      } Time = 0.0770
      /etc/profile.d/modules.sh{
      } Time = 0.0997
      /etc/profile.d/z99_PrgEnv.sh{
      } Time = 0.2067
      /etc/bash.bashrc{
      } Time = 0.2338
    } Time = 0.3156

If you wish to create a file instead of writing to standard out, change the value:

   export SHELL_STARTUP_DEBUG=3

There will be a separate file for each shell invocation.


See INSTALL for instructions.
